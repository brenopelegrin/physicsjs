# physicsjs

The "physicsjs" project aims to make simulations of various physical phenomena available on the internet. Each type of physical model has a graphical interface, which can help people understand the concepts involved in that phenomenon, and an API that enables users to obtain raw data about the simulations.

## Getting Started

The project consists of a React frontend that allows the user to control variables, tune the simulations and visualize the simulations results in graphs or other media. The frontend makes requests to an API based on [flask-tasks-docker](https://github.com/brenopelegrin/flask-tasks-docker), that registers a task in a queue and proccess them.

### Front-end
The documentation for the frontend is still not available, but will be added soon.

### Back-end
The documentation for backend can be found [here](https://github.com/brenopelegrin/physicsjs/blob/master/backend/README.md).
