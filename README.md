# physicsjs (now **physicsonweb**)

The "physics on web" project aims to make simulations of various physical phenomena available on the internet. You can explore physical models thorugh a graphical interface to understand the concepts involved in that phenomenon, and can obtain raw data thorugh the API.

## Getting Started

The project consists of a React frontend that allows the user to control variables, tune the simulations and visualize the simulations results in graphs or other media. The frontend makes requests to an API based on [flask-tasks-docker](https://github.com/brenopelegrin/flask-tasks-docker), that registers a task in a queue and proccess them.

### Front-end
The documentation for the frontend is still not available, but will be added soon.

### Back-end
The documentation for backend can be found [here](https://github.com/brenopelegrin/physicsjs/blob/master/backend/README.md).
